Linear Regression (Step 3): The lm() function is used to create a linear regression model to predict doors knocked based on week and calls made.
Monte Carlo Simulation (Step 4): This simulation predicts the possible number of doors knocked by considering the variability in calls made.
Incremental Goal Setting (Step 5): Goals are set to incrementally increase the predicted doors knocked by a certain percentage.
Visualization (Step 6): Historical and predicted data are visualized to track performance over time.
Optimization (Step 7): The optimx() function is used to find the optimal allocation of resources to maximize door-knocking efforts.
